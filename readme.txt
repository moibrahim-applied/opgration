Dear Sean,


I hope this email finds you well. I am Ibrahim from Patrium. I received your email from Amr - the  AI Engineer through Linkedin where he expressed MMG could potentially be interested in seeing what Patrium has to offer. 

I first came across MMG’s work a few months ago on LinkedIn, where your campaigns and data-driven approach to media strategy immediately made sense to get in touch with you.  We are targeting companies that priortize data, and intelligence in the advertising space. 



so wanted to personally follow up, and apologize for the delay. We’ve been focused on Patrium’s expansion into the North American market and onboarding several global partners, but I’ve been looking forward to re-establishing the conversation and sharing how what we’re building at Patrium aligns so naturally with MMG’s vision.

At Patrium, we’re building an AI-native consultancy that flips the traditional model: instead of human consultants using AI, AI becomes the consultant. Our multi-agent platform is designed to benchmark, diagnose, and accelerate AI maturity across entire organizations, creating a clear roadmap for workflow integration to leadership strategy and creative decisioning, allowing for gained insights at each level of the organization’s hierarchy. 

Our proprietary AI Readiness Benchmarking Suite helps companies like MMG:

* Quantify organizational AI maturity across departments, workflows, and leadership layers.
* Benchmark performance against media and tech industry standards to identify hidden opportunities.
* Visualize AI ROI through operational and financial impact metrics.
* Accelerate transformation using adaptive multi-agent systems that embed directly into existing data and workflow ecosystems.

Hope Amr gave you breif of what we do but In short, Patrium gives you a real-time mirror into how effectively your organization is leveraging AI, and what steps can compound that advantage. It’s a consulting model built for leaders who don’t just want strategy decks, but measurable progress, where each employee signed up on our platform can see productivity gains from learning about the world of Tech and AI.

I’d love to organize a call or live demo to show what Patrium can do, specifically tailored around MMG’s AI initiatives and campaign operations. Given how aligned your vision is with ours, I’m confident this will be an exciting discussion. 

Warm regards,
Ibrahim
Founder & CEO — Patrium
